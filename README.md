# COVID19_Prediction
## Introduction
Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning Techniques, I tried to answer the following question :  
"Does the food diet influence the cumulative numbers of contaminations and deaths due to COVID-19 ?"

## Data
We will use two different databases, the first one (found on link : https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) contains a lot of information on daily contaminations and deaths due to COVID-19 as well as numbers cumulated by country between the month of March and the month of December 2020.

The second one “Dietary Intake Estimates” , (found on website : https://www.globaldietarydatabase.org/) gives a huge amount of data on food diet by country, by sub-region, and globally. The observation period is between 1990 and 2018.

## Steps 
The problem should be devided into two parts, the first one answers the question concerning deaths only, and the second one concerns the cumulative numbers.
